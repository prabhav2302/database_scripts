# AirBnB MongoDB Analysis

A little assignment to practice importing and analyzing data within a MongoDB database.


## Dataset Details
My dataset is about AirBnB listings in Broward County,Florida. This is the [link](http://data.insideairbnb.com/united-states/fl/broward-county/2021-02-23/data/listings.csv.gz) to the dataset. The file was originally in a CSV format, however MongoDB has no problem dealing with data which has a fixed schema.  
  
Here are the first 20 entries in the raw csv file.

My wife and I were at the airport getting ready to fly back to the United States from Halifax, Nova Scotia and I found him.  We spent two weeks on vacation in Nova Scotia and never saw any Mounties.  We finally got to meet some Mounties on our last day there.  To bad they were cardboard Mounties.  What a bummer!   ****************          My wife and I are both retired.  We love to travel.  We have always planned to travel when we retired.  Over the years we have purchased several timeshare units in many places.  We have owned timeshare units in Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Mexico and Tennessee.  Using the concept of  timeshare unit exchange, we have vacationed in a lot of  very interesting and special places.  You could call us the “timeshare travelers”.   We often travel 10 to 12 weeks out of the year.  Due to various and sundry reasons in our life we are have decided to put several units up for rent. We do not want to sell them.  If is to our advantage to rent them rather than bank them with our exchange company. ************************* Some units we own, we have never stayed in, personally used or seen.  The only reason we bought these timeshare units were to get the exchange power or points power of the unit for future timeshare exchanges.  All the units are great vacation locations,  Most of the units we are putting up for rent are located in southeast Florida in the months of January and February.  These units are deeded to us one certain week out of each year.  As deeded owners of the units, we pay our share of the cost for maintenance and support staff each year.   ************************* It you are not familiar with timeshare units go to your favorite search engine and put "timeshare tutorial" in the search box.  When you get the search results you can read to your hearts content  on the subject of timeshares ownership.  There are good points and bad points in owning timeshares.   We're going to become our own timeshare exchange, the your cash  for our assets (our timeshare units) exchange.  The newest exchange in the world I guest.  Let's shorten the name and  call it "Cash For Assets Exchange".  *********************** If you rent one of our timeshare units, we will not be present when you arrive.  We will be your virtual host.  All of our units have personal for check-in during specific time frames and arrangement for after hour check-ins can be made.   Most of our units have a front desk that is manned  24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  I like that.     ************************ Good luck in your search a place for the ideal place to stay while on you travel adventure. Send me an Email if you have any questions about our units. ********************************************************* Felix,the  Timeshare Traveler |within a day      |50%               |N/A                 |f                |https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/1235314/profile_pic/1317534657/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small     |https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/1235314/profile_pic/1317534657/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium     |                  |1                  |1                        |['phone', 'facebook', 'reviews', 'jumio', 'offline_government_id', 'selfie', 'government_id', 'identity_manual']         |t                   |t                     |                                         |Pompano Beach         |                            |26.24347|-80.08914|Entire apartment           |Entire home/apt|4           |         |1 bath          |1       |1   |["Dryer", "Carbon monoxide alarm", "Fire extinguisher", "Smoke alarm", "Elevator", "Free parking on premises", "Hot tub", "Pool", "Cable TV", "Wifi", "Washer", "Heating", "Kitchen", "Air conditioning", "Gym"]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |$175.00|7             |7             |7                     |7                     |7                     |7                     |7.0                   |7.0                   |                |t               |30             |60             |90             |365             |2021-02-26           |0                |0                    |0                     |            |           |                    |                      |                         |                     |                           |                      |                   |       |f               |1                             |1                                          |0                                           |0                                          |                 |

After importing the dataset into MongoDB, I noticed a slight problem in the ```description``` field. I saw that certain records in the ```description``` field in the CSV, still had the HTML tags such as 
```html  
<br>
<br>
<br />
```

The line below, for example was in the description field for a certain record after importing onto MongoDB
```html
<br /><br /><b>The space</b><br />Peaceful house on Nature Preserve Close to everything. Hollywood, Florida Vacation Rental, South East, Florida, USA <br />
```  

In order to remove these HTML tags in the description field. I created my program called munge.py. My program goes into the CSV file and removes these HTML tags from the description field. It then generated a new file called listings_clean.csv which contained the description field without HTML tags. This is how the line above looked after I ran munge.py:
```
The space  Peaceful house on Nature Preserve Close to everything. Hollywood, Florida Vacation Rental, South East, Florida, USA
```

### Query 3  
After observing the query above, I noticed that both Tracy and Paul were superhosts. Tracy had a host_id of 351303. Paul had a host_id of 1097874

```javascript
let q3_filter = {
  "$or": [
    {
      host_id: 351303,
    },
    {
      host_id: 1097874,
    },
  ],
}

let q3_projection = {
    _id:0, 
    name: 1,
    price: 1, 
    neighbourhood: 1, 
    host_name: 1, 
    host_is_superhost: 1,
}

db.listings.find(q3_filter,q3_projection)
```  
Sample Documents: 
```javascript  
{ "name" : "2 bd/2ba Oceanfront Condo", "host_name" : "Tracy", "host_is_superhost" : "t", "neighbourhood" : "", "price" : "$140.00" }
{ "name" : "Gorgeous Private Las Olas-Idlewyld Home", "host_name" : "Paul", "host_is_superhost" : "t", "neighbourhood" : "Fort Lauderdale, Florida, United States", "price" : "$479.00" }
{ "name" : "Luxury Oceanfront Condo with Two Master suites", "host_name" : "Tracy", "host_is_superhost" : "t", "neighbourhood" : "", "price" : "$175.00" }
```
Insight:  
This shows that Tracy has two listings and Paul has one listing. Paul's listing costs about 479$, whereas Tracy has one listing for 140 and one listing for 175$.

### Query 4  
```javascript  
db.listings.distinct( "host_name" )
```  
Sample Documents:
```javascript
"A. Hanes",
"AMG Luxe",
"Aaron",
"Aaron Isaac",
```

### Query 5
```javascript
let q5_filter = {
  $match:{
    "neighbourhood_cleansed": "Hollywood",
    "beds": {
        $gt:2,
    },
    "review_scores_rating":{
        $ne:"",
    }
  }
}

let q5_projection = {
  $project:{
    _id:0,
    name:1,
    beds:1,
    city:1,
    review_scores_rating:1,
    price:1,
  }
}

let q5_sorting = {
    $sort:{
    review_scores_rating: -1
    }
}

db.listings.aggregate([q5_filter,q5_projection,q5_sorting])
```

Sample Documents: 
```javascript
{ "name" : "SPECTACULAR DIRECT OCEANFRONT VIEWS - Amazing", "beds" : 3, "price" : "$125.00", "review_scores_rating" : 100 }
{ "name" : "Quiet and Cozy yet Convenient", "beds" : 3, "price" : "$150.00", "review_scores_rating" : 100 }
{ "name" : "PENTHOUSE SUITE HOLLYWOOD BEACH,FL", "beds" : 3, "price" : "$128.00", "review_scores_rating" : 100 }
```  
  
Insight:  
One can rent a nice place in Hollywood Florida, with 3 or more beds for around the price range of $100-300. My dataset did not have the "neighbourhood_group_cleansed" field so instead I used the "neighbourhood_cleansed" field instead for the matching.

### Query 6

```javascript
let q6_grouping = {
  $group: {
  _id: "$host_id",
  listingCount: {$sum: 1}
  }
}
db.listings.aggregate([q6_grouping])
```
Sample Documents: 
```javascript
{ "_id" : 377647361, "listingCount" : 1 }
{ "_id" : 41837361, "listingCount" : 2 }
{ "_id" : 151861939, "listingCount" : 1 }
```

### Query 7

```javascript
let q7_grouping = {
  $group: {
    _id:"$neighbourhood_cleansed",
    avg_rating: {$avg:"$review_scores_rating"},
  },
};

let q7_matching = {$match:
  {avg_rating:{$gt:95 }}
}

let q7_sorting = {$sort:
  {avg_rating:-1}
}

db.listings.aggregate([q7_grouping,q7_matching,q7_sorting])
```  
  
Sample Documents: 
```javascript
{ "_id" : "Tribal Land", "avg_rating" : 100 }
{ "_id" : "Hillsboro Beach", "avg_rating" : 99.63636363636364 }
{ "_id" : "Southwest Ranches", "avg_rating" : 99.23076923076923 }
```
  
Insights:  
It appears Tribal Land, Hillsboro Beach, and Southwest Ranches are the 3 neighbourhoods in Broward country with the top average review score rating. Potential visitors may want to take this into account when choosing which neighbourhood to live in for their stay. My dataset did not have the "neighbourhood_group_cleansed" field so instead I used the "neighbourhood_cleansed" field instead for the grouping.

## Extra-credit
This assignment deserves extra credit. The file named extra_credit.py in the main directory reproduces query 5 using the pymongo module. This was the output on the terminal:
